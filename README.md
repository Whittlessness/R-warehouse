# Data Science Portfolio
Hi my name is Luke,

I believe that the secret to rectifying our errors and creating a better future is within the data the world creates everyday. I aspire to contribute to this revolution, and believe that there is a lot of good business to be done within this new world.
Below are a few projects showcasing coding within R and Python, I also am familar with SQL and dataframe management. 

## [Project #1: Three decades of Australian Climate Neglect by Sector](https://github.com/Whittlessness/R-warehouse/blob/main/Three%20decades%20of%20Australian%20Climate%20Neglect%20by%20Sector.Rmd)
* Sourced a public global database on CO2 emissions per sector for every country in the world with available data. 
* Cleaned data through factorisation with base R code, String manipulation with Stringr and renaming and dropping empty variables with DPYLR
* Manipulated the dataset to tidy Principles with TIDYR
* Creating new variables for future insights with DPYLR
* Subset to country specific 
* Used the z.score method to search for outliers 
* Plotted by sector with analysis into specific narratives, inferring on results with special consideration to possible outside influencers

## [Project #2: Video streamer algorithm analysis; strenghts and weakenesses of current test](https://github.com/Whittlessness/R-warehouse/blob/main/WNW%20report.Rmd)
* Create a report of current algorithm effectiveness
* Look for data disparity 
* Assess current A/B test and look for improvements
* Establish own Hypothesis Tests 
* Correct sample sizes for A/B test 
* Complete single & mutiple regressions models 
* Conclude on results, affirm on the theory and recommend improving the process by reducing the Margin of Error.

## [Project #3: Python Analysis and ML model build](https://github.com/Whittlessness/Warehouse/blob/main/python%20ML.ipynb)
* Source a supervised dataset 
* Use Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn & scikitlearn packages 
* Visualise scatter matrix for variable relationship determination 
* Encoding caregorical variables for model fitting
* Test and train with both KNN and DT models to determine the most efficient

**The below is the result of the Decision tree Model which was slightly more accurate when predicting the minorities within the data**
