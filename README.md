# Data Science Portfolio
An example of using R and Python for data analysis and problem solving. 

## [Project #1: Three decades of Australian Climate Neglect by Sector](https://github.com/Whittlessness/R-warehouse/blob/main/Three%20decades%20of%20Australian%20Climate%20Neglect%20by%20Sector.Rmd)
* Sourced a global database on CO2 emissions per sector for every country in the world with available data. 
* Cleaned data through factorisation with base R code, String manipulation with Stringr and renaming and dropping empty variables with DPYLR
* Manipulated the dataset to tidy Principles with TIDYR
* Creating new variables for future insights with DPYLR
* Subset to country specific 
* Used the z.score method to search for outliers 
* Plotted by sector with analysis into specific narratives, inferring on results with special consideration to outside influencers
